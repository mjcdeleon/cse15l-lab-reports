# Getting Started
## Visual Studio Code
Hello! And welcome to the course! First, we if you plan to use your personal computer or laptop for this course we must ensure you have the proper set up. (For those who plan to use the lab's computers, you can skip the set up!)

### Step one
Install [Visual Studio Code] (https://code.visualstudio.com/) to your personal device, there are instructions on the site to which you can follow for help when installing.

After installing, you should end up with a screen such as this
[for later, add screenshot of home screen of VSC here]

## Remote Connection
### Step two
Another installation ! Here we are going to start accessing our course-specific account, for this (if you do not have it already) you will need to install something called `git`. For this you will need to download it here [insert link here]

Insert instructions on how to install git

After you've installed git onto your device you will set git-bash as your default terminal setting, as so:

Insert instructions here

Once all that is done, open up a new terminal (ensuring that it is bash), in the terminal type:
'ssh cs15lsp23--@ieng6.ucsd.edu'
in which the '--' pieces are replaced with the unique two letters for your course-specific account.

From here, you will receive a message from the server as it is the first time you have connected. The ending message should read:
'Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])?'
You will type 'yes' so as to log in, from here another message will appear:
'Password: '
Input your course-specific password. (It is important to note that as you type the characters will not appear within the terminal visibly, however these characters are still being inputted)

Once logged in, you will receive this message:

## Commands
### Step Three
Great! You're all logged in, now let's use some of the concepts we've learned/ heard about in class here in our own terminal

Here is a list of some commands you can try:
